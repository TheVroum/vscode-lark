# Lark grammar syntax support for VSCode

Adds syntax highlighting to [Lark](https://github.com/lark-parser/lark) files in VSCode.

The grammars should end with `.lark`.

Contributions are greatly appreciated.
Please fork this repository and open a pull request to make grammar tweaks, add support for other subgrammars etc.
